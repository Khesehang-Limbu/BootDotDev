Duplicates
Players are complaining that they aren't able to see their collections easily. Currently every collectible item is displayed, even the duplicates. Players only want to see each artifact once, even if they have collected more than one of them.

Assignment
Complete the remove_duplicates function. It accepts a list of strings and removes any duplicate values. It should utilize and return a set, not a list!

Bonus points if you can write the body of the function in a single line of code.
