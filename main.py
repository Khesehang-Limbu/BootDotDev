What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming, or "OOP", is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code. Not everyone agrees that object-oriented principles are the best way to write code, but, to be a good engineer, you should at least understand them.

In this course, we'll be coding the pieces of a real-time strategy game called "Age of Dragons". Players control armies of people, elves, orcs, and dragons and battle each other. It's similar to Age of Empires or StarCraft.

Assignment
One of the greatest sins when trying to write "clean code" is using misleading names for your variables and functions. Take a look at the destroy_wall function. Based on its name, you might assume that it destroys a single wall, but if you look closely, you'll see that it handles multiple walls.

The test suite expects a different function name. Take a look at the main_test.py file to see what it's looking for, and rename the function accordingly.

Additionally, try to rename the variables inside the function to be more descriptive. After passing the tests, take a look at the solution to see how we named everything.

def destroy_walls(wall_healths):
    for w in wall_healths:
        if w <= 0:
            wall_healths.remove(w)
    return wall_healths
